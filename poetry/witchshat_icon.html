        <h2 class="poemtitle">A Witch's Chant by James Hogg</h2>
        <p class="poem">
          Thou art weary, weary, weary, Thou art weary and far away, Hear me,
          gentle spirit, hear me, Come before the dawn of day. I hear a small
          voice from the hill, The vapour is deadly, pale, and still— A
          murmuring sough is on the wood, And the witching star is red as blood.
          And in the cleft of heaven I scan The giant form of a naked man, His
          eye is like the burning brand, And he holds a sword in his right hand.
          All is not well. By dint of spell, Somewhere between the heaven and
          hell There is this night a wild deray, The spirits have wander'd from
          their way. The purple drops shall tinge the moon As she wanders
          through the midnight noon; And the dawning heaven shall all be red
          With blood by guilty angels shed. Be as it will, I have the skill To
          work by good or work by ill; Then here's for pain, and here's for
          thrall, And here's for conscience, worst of all. Another chant, and
          then, and then, Spirits shall come or Christian men— Come from the
          earth, the air, or the sea, Great Gil-Moules, I cry to thee! Sleep'st
          thou, wakest thou, lord of the wind, Mount thy steeds and gallop them
          blind; And the long-tailed fiery dragon outfly The rocket of heaven,
          the bomb of the sky. Over the dog-star, over the wain, Over the cloud,
          and the rainbow's mane, Over the mountain, and over the sea,
          Haste—haste—haste to me! Then here's for trouble, and here's for
          smart, And here's for the pang that seeks the heart; Here's for
          madness, and here's for thrall, And here's for conscience, the worst
          of all!
