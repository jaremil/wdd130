      <h2>The Murderess by Alice Cary</h2>
      <p>
        Along the still cold plain o'erhead, In pale embattled crowds. The stars
        their tents of darkness spread, And camped among the clouds; Cinctured
        with shadows, like a wraith, Night moaned along the lea; Like the blue
        hungry eye of Death, Shone the perfidious sea; The moon was wearing to
        the wane, The winds were wild and high, And a red meteor's flaming mane
        Streamed from the northern sky. Across the black and barren moor, Her
        dainty bosom bare; And white lips sobbing evermore, Rides Eleanor the
        fair. So hath the pining sea-maid plained For love of mortal lips,
        Riding the billows, silver-reined. Hard by disastrous ships. Why covers
        she her mournful eyes? Why do her pulses cease, As if she saw before her
        rise The ghost of murdered Peace? From out her path the ground-bird
        drifts With wildly startled calls, The moonlight snake its white fold
        lifts From where her shadow falls. Ah me! I that delicate hand of hers,
        Now trembling like a reed. Like to the ancient mariner's Hath done a
        hellish deed; And full of mercy were the frown Which might the power
        impart To press the eternal darkness down Against her bleeding heart.
