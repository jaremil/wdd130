      <h2>Ghost Prisoner by Heid Erdrich</h2>
      <p>
        The ghost prisoner, a murderer, wishes he was invisible, sheer air,
        already dead. His narrow bed washes him away to dream escape through
        holy gaps that open in the grin of his small son. Lost teeth offer him a
        freedom so absurd he wakes and laughs. No one hears the ghost prisoner.
        Whether he groans or bears stoically what instruments we've paid to play
        this march toward a freedom so absurd we wake and silently shake our
        heads. We do not speak ill of the dead. The ghost prisoner, still
        murderer, wishes he was visible, fiery air, rallying the dead. His
        narrow cell just the place for prayer. Holy, holy, a ghost's revenge
        pushed through gaps in his own gashed mouth, a curse so absurd, he wakes
        to its howl. No one says his name, his crimes, how many jolts it took to
        resurrect him as a betrayer of insurrection, paying for freedom's ring.
        We do not want to know what it took. We'd rather not speak the dead ill.
        We do not want to know what it took to make him wish he were dead still.
