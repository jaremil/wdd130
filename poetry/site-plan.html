      <h3>Poem's Page: A Witch's Chant by James Hogg</h3>
      <p>
        Each Poem has it's own icon that will be shown on this page deprending
        on which poem it is. This page will desplay James Hogg's poem: Thou art
        weary, weary, weary, Thou art weary and far away, Hear me, gentle
        spirit, hear me, Come before the dawn of day. I hear a small voice from
        the hill, The vapour is deadly, pale, and still— A murmuring sough is on
        the wood, And the witching star is red as blood. And in the cleft of
        heaven I scan The giant form of a naked man, His eye is like the burning
        brand, And he holds a sword in his right hand. All is not well. By dint
        of spell, Somewhere between the heaven and hell There is this night a
        wild deray, The spirits have wander'd from their way. The purple drops
        shall tinge the moon As she wanders through the midnight noon; And the
        dawning heaven shall all be red With blood by guilty angels shed. Be as
        it will, I have the skill To work by good or work by ill; Then here's
        for pain, and here's for thrall, And here's for conscience, worst of
        all. Another chant, and then, and then, Spirits shall come or Christian
        men— Come from the earth, the air, or the sea, Great Gil-Moules, I cry
        to thee! Sleep'st thou, wakest thou, lord of the wind, Mount thy steeds
        and gallop them blind; And the long-tailed fiery dragon outfly The
        rocket of heaven, the bomb of the sky. Over the dog-star, over the wain,
        Over the cloud, and the rainbow's mane, Over the mountain, and over the
        sea, Haste—haste—haste to me! Then here's for trouble, and here's for
        smart, And here's for the pang that seeks the heart; Here's for madness,
        and here's for thrall, And here's for conscience, the worst of all!

        here it is- I hold it towards you.

      <h3>Poem's Page: Ghost Prisoner by Heid Erdrich</h3>
      <p>
        Each Poem has it's own icon that will be shown on this page deprending
        on which poem it is. This page will display Heid Erdrich's poem: The
        ghost prisoner, a murderer, wishes he was invisible, sheer air, already
        dead. His narrow bed washes him away to dream escape through holy gaps
        that open in the grin of his small son. Lost teeth offer him a freedom
        so absurd he wakes and laughs. No one hears the ghost prisoner. Whether
        he groans or bears stoically what instruments we've paid to play this
        march toward a freedom so absurd we wake and silently shake our heads.
        We do not speak ill of the dead. The ghost prisoner, still murderer,
        wishes he was visible, fiery air, rallying the dead. His narrow cell
        just the place for prayer. Holy, holy, a ghost's revenge pushed through
        gaps in his own gashed mouth, a curse so absurd, he wakes to its howl.
        No one says his name, his crimes, how many jolts it took to resurrect
        him as a betrayer of insurrection, paying for freedom's ring. We do not
        want to know what it took. We'd rather not speak the dead ill. We do not
        want to know what it took to make him wish he were dead still.

      <h3>Poem's Page: The Raven by Edgar Allan Poe</h3>
      <p>
        Each Poem has it's own icon that will be shown on this page deprending
        on which poem it is. This page will display Edgar Allan Poe's poem: Once
        upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, Over many a
        quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore— While I nodded, nearly
        napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of some one gently rapping,
        rapping at my chamber door. ''Tis some visitor,' I muttered, 'tapping at
        my chamber door— Only this and nothing more.' Ah, distinctly I remember
        it was in the bleak December; And each separate dying ember wrought its
        ghost upon the floor. Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought
        to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
        For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore— Nameless
        here for evermore. And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each
        purple curtain Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt
        before; So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
        ''Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door— Some late
        visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;— This it is and nothing
        more.' Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
        'Sir,' said I, 'or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; But the fact
        is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, And so faintly you
        came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, That I scarce was sure I heard
        you'—here I opened wide the door;— Darkness there and nothing more. Deep
        into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
        Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before; But the
        silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token, And the only word
        there spoken was the whispered word, 'Lenore?' This I whispered, and an
        echo murmured back the word, 'Lenore!’— Merely this and nothing more.
        Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, Soon again
        I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before. 'Surely,' said I, 'surely
        that is something at my window lattice; Let me see, then, what thereat
        is, and this mystery explore— Let my heart be still a moment and this
        mystery explore;— 'Tis the wind and nothing more!' Open here I flung the
        shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, In there stepped a stately
        Raven of the saintly days of yore; Not the least obeisance made he; not
        a minute stopped or stayed he; But, with mien of lord or lady, perched
        above my chamber door— Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my
        chamber door— Perched, and sat, and nothing more. Then this ebony bird
        beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, By the grave and stern decorum of
        the countenance it wore, 'Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,' I
        said, 'art sure no craven, Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from
        the Nightly shore— Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's
        Plutonian shore!' Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore.' Much I marvelled this
        ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, Though its answer little
        meaning—little relevancy bore; For we cannot help agreeing that no
        living human being Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his
        chamber door— Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber
        door, With such name as 'Nevermore.' But the Raven, sitting lonely on
        the placid bust, spoke only That one word, as if his soul in that one
        word he did outpour. Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then
        he fluttered— Till I scarcely more than muttered 'Other friends have
        flown before— On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown
        before.' Then the bird said 'Nevermore.' Startled at the stillness
        broken by reply so aptly spoken, 'Doubtless,' said I, 'what it utters is
        its only stock and store Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful
        Disaster Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden
        bore— Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore Of
        “Never—nevermore”.' But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into
        smiling, Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust
        and door; Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
        Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore— What this
        grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore Meant in
        croaking 'Nevermore.' This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable
        expressing To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
        This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining On the
        cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er, But whose
        velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er, She shall press,
        ah, nevermore! Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an
        unseen censer Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted
        floor. 'Wretch,' I cried, 'thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he
        hath sent thee Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;
        Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!' Quoth
        the Raven 'Nevermore.' 'Prophet!' said I, 'thing of evil!—prophet still,
        if bird or devil!— Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee
        here ashore, Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—
        On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore— Is there—is
        there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!' Quoth the Raven
        'Nevermore.' 'Prophet!' said I, 'thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird
        or devil! By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—
        Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn, It shall
        clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore— Clasp a rare and
        radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.' Quoth the Raven
        'Nevermore.' 'Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!' I
        shrieked, upstarting— 'Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's
        Plutonian shore! Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul
        hath spoken! Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!
        Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!'
        Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore.' And the Raven, never flitting, still is
        sitting, still is sitting On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my
        chamber door; And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is
        dreaming, And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the
        floor; And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
        Shall be lifted—nevermore!

        Each Poem has it's own icon that will be shown on this page deprending
        on which poem it is. This page will display Alice Cary's poem: Along the
        still cold plain o'erhead, In pale embattled crowds. The stars their
        tents of darkness spread, And camped among the clouds; Cinctured with
        shadows, like a wraith, Night moaned along the lea; Like the blue hungry
        eye of Death, Shone the perfidious sea; The moon was wearing to the
        wane, The winds were wild and high, And a red meteor's flaming mane
        Streamed from the northern sky. Across the black and barren moor, Her
        dainty bosom bare; And white lips sobbing evermore, Rides Eleanor the
        fair. So hath the pining sea-maid plained For love of mortal lips,
        Riding the billows, silver-reined. Hard by disastrous ships. Why covers
        she her mournful eyes? Why do her pulses cease, As if she saw before her
        rise The ghost of murdered Peace? From out her path the ground-bird
        drifts With wildly startled calls, The moonlight snake its white fold
        lifts From where her shadow falls. Ah me! I that delicate hand of hers,
        Now trembling like a reed. Like to the ancient mariner's Hath done a
        hellish deed; And full of mercy were the frown Which might the power
        impart To press the eternal darkness down Against her bleeding heart.

        black clouds gathered overhead, veiling the moonlight with guise dread.
        Wind weaves with howls, and spies embed a gaunt hollow man in its stead,
        lifting his black mound shroud a ted, refusing to release its dead.
        Strain, he stands searchingly ahead; pain screams rip from his throat
        and bled. A stir in the air dares to sped on as he falls to his knees
        unfed.

        Poem's Page: To The Dead in the Graveyard Underneath My Window by

      <p>
        Each Poem has it's own icon that will be shown on this page deprending
        on which poem it is. This page will display Adelaide Crapsey's poem:
        Written in A Moment of Exasperation How can you lie so still? All day I
        watch And never a blade of all the green sod moves To show where
        restlessly you toss and turn, And fling a desperate arm or draw up knees
        Stiffened and aching from their long disuse; I watch all night and not
        one ghost comes forth To take its freedom of the midnight hour. Oh, have
        you no rebellion in your bones? The very worms must scorn you where you
        lie, A pallid mouldering acquiescent folk, Meek habitants of unresented
        graves. Why are you there in your straight row on row Where I must ever
        see you from my bed That in your mere dumb presence iterate The text so
        weary in my ears: "Lie still And rest; be patient and lie still and
        rest." I'll not be patient! I will not lie still! There is a brown road
        runs between the pines, And further on the purple woodlands lie, And
        still beyond blue mountains lift and loom; And I would walk the road and
        I would be Deep in the wooded shade and I would reach The windy mountain
        tops that touch the clouds. My eyes may follow but my feet are held.
        Recumbent as you others must I too Submit? Be mimic of your movelessness
        With pillow and counterpane for stone and sod? And if the many sayings
        of the wise Teach of submission I will not submit But with a spirit all
        unreconciled Flash an unquenched defiance to the stars. Better it is to
        walk, to run, to dance, Better it is to laugh and leap and sing, To know
        the open skies of dawn and night, To move untrammeled down the flaming
        noon, And I will clamour it through weary days Keeping the edge of
        deprivation sharp, Nor with the pliant speaking on my lips Of
        resignation, sister to defeat. I'll not be patient. I will not lie
        still. And in ironic quietude who is The despot of our days and lord of
        dust Needs but, scarce heeding, wait to drop Grim casual comment on
        rebellion's end; "Yes, yes . . Wilful and petulant but now As dead and
        quiet as the others are." And this each body and ghost of you hath heard
        That in your graves do therefore lie so still.

        'Is there anybody there?' said the Traveller, Knocking on the moonlit
        door; And his horse in the silence champed the grasses Of the forest's
        ferny floor: And a bird flew up out of the turret, Above the Traveller's
        head: And he smote upon the door again a second time; 'Is there anybody
        there?'' he said. But no one descended to the Traveller; No head from
        the leaf-fringed sill Leaned over and looked into his grey eyes, Where
        he stood perplexed and still. But only a host of phantom listeners That
        dwelt in the lone house then Stood listening in the quiet of the
        moonlight To that voice from the world of men: Stood thronging the faint
        moonbeams on the dark stair, That goes down to the empty hall,
        Hearkening in an air stirred and shaken By the lonely Traveller's call.
        And he felt in his heart their strangeness, Their stillness answering
        his cry, While his horse moved, cropping the dark turf, 'Neath the
        starred and leafy sky; For he suddenly smote on the door, even Louder,
        and lifted his head:— 'Tell them I came, and no one answered, That I
        kept my word,'' he said. Never the least stir made the listeners, Though
        every word he spake Fell echoing through the shadowiness of the still
        house From the one man left awake: Ay, they heard his foot upon the
        stirrup, And the sound of iron on stone, And how the silence surged
        softly backward, When the plunging hoofs were gone.

        Orange and tawny gold clusters And I am called pumpkins. On the last of

        Singing ghost songs And love to the harvest moon; I am a jack-o'-lantern
        With terrible teeth And the children know I am fooling.
