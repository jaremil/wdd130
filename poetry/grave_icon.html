      <h2>
        To The Dead in the Graveyard Underneath My Window by Adelaide Crapsey
      </h2>
      <p>
        Written in A Moment of Exasperation How can you lie so still? All day I
        watch And never a blade of all the green sod moves To show where
        restlessly you toss and turn, And fling a desperate arm or draw up knees
        Stiffened and aching from their long disuse; I watch all night and not
        one ghost comes forth To take its freedom of the midnight hour. Oh, have
        you no rebellion in your bones? The very worms must scorn you where you
        lie, A pallid mouldering acquiescent folk, Meek habitants of unresented
        graves. Why are you there in your straight row on row Where I must ever
        see you from my bed That in your mere dumb presence iterate The text so
        weary in my ears: "Lie still And rest; be patient and lie still and
        rest." I'll not be patient! I will not lie still! There is a brown road
        runs between the pines, And further on the purple woodlands lie, And
        still beyond blue mountains lift and loom; And I would walk the road and
        I would be Deep in the wooded shade and I would reach The windy mountain
        tops that touch the clouds. My eyes may follow but my feet are held.
        Recumbent as you others must I too Submit? Be mimic of your movelessness
        With pillow and counterpane for stone and sod? And if the many sayings
        of the wise Teach of submission I will not submit But with a spirit all
        unreconciled Flash an unquenched defiance to the stars. Better it is to
        walk, to run, to dance, Better it is to laugh and leap and sing, To know
        the open skies of dawn and night, To move untrammeled down the flaming
        noon, And I will clamour it through weary days Keeping the edge of
        deprivation sharp, Nor with the pliant speaking on my lips Of
        resignation, sister to defeat. I'll not be patient. I will not lie
        still. And in ironic quietude who is The despot of our days and lord of
        dust Needs but, scarce heeding, wait to drop Grim casual comment on
        rebellion's end; "Yes, yes . . Wilful and petulant but now As dead and
        quiet as the others are." And this each body and ghost of you hath heard
        That in your graves do therefore lie so still.
